**Pip**

Pip is a rather simple concept of Python, but it's one that makes Python so amazing.
Pip is the Python package manager, and it helps you install everything you need to make
your program run. Unlike other languages, pip makes dependencies extremely easy.

You can use pip in the cmd by simply running the command 'pip'
Look through all of the options you might want to use, but many people just use
'pip install <program name>', and it works like magic! tada!

Example: pip install tensorflow
